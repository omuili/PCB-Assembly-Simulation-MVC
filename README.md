# PCB Assembly Simulation - MVC Architecture

A comprehensive Java Swing application demonstrating Model-View-Controller architecture with integrated design patterns for simulating printed circuit board manufacturing processes.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns across Model, View, and Controller layers
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic PCB type creation
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time view updates and event notifications  
- **DAO Pattern**: Database access abstraction
- **Repository Pattern**: Data persistence layer

## Features

### Three Interactive Views
- **Run Simulation**: Execute new PCB assembly simulations
- **Query Results**: Search and filter historical simulation data
- **View Reports**: Detailed failure analysis and statistics

### Technical Capabilities
- Persistent file-based database storage
- Real-time failure rate calculations
- Multi-board type support (Test, Sensor, Gateway)
- Statistical success rate analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Swing GUI library (included in JDK)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omuili/PCB-Assembly-Simulation-MVC.git
